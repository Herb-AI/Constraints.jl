"""
    mutable struct State 

A state to be solved by the constraint [`Solver`](@ref).
A state contains of:

- `tree`: A partial AST
- `on_tree_manipulation`: The local constraints that apply to this tree. 
   These constraints are enforced each time the tree is modified.
- `isfeasible`: Flag to indicate if this state is still feasible.
   When a propagator spots an inconsistency, this field will be set to false.
   Tree manipulations and further propagations are not allowed on infeasible states
