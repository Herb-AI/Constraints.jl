"""
    mutable struct State 

A state to be solved by the constraint [`Solver`](@ref).
A state contains of:

- `tree`: A partial AST
- `size`: The size of the tree. This is a cached value which prevents
   having to traverse the entire tree each time the size is needed.
- `constraints`: The local constraints that apply to this tree. 
   These constraints are enforced each time the tree is modified.
